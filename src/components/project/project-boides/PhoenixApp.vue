            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">How it started</h3>
            <p>After learning the stack of the main app Always Here I
                graduated to collaborate on the admin tool, Phoenix. At the time it was not known as Phoenix, but
                rather just "the admin tool" and at one stage its logo was my face.
                <br>
                <br>
                Anyway, although daunting at first to be working on two project at the same time I was somewhat
                excited.
                Turns out its wasn't so bad and the excitement was warranted, as this is where I was introduced
                to Tailwind Css (the best).

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">My Approach</h3>
            <p>Once again still being new to the whole workforce and programming thing, I committed myself to
                learning all I could. This mainly consisted
                of learning how Tailwind Css worked and at first doubting its greatness as I had to go back and
                forth between the documentation for each css class which I already knew. Little did I know that
                this
                would speed up my development time substantially in the future.

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">Learning Experiences</h3>
            <p>My time working on Phoenix was a good one, learning to enjoy the creation process and joys of Tailwind.

                Technically, this project was confusing at first, as there was a lot of functionality especially
                the drag and drop. Having at
                least 120 unique interactions on the page as it was a flow builder with many different types of
                blocks. With this in mind optimization was definitely a challenge, learning to pay close attention
                to every block of code to shave off as
                much latency as I could.
                <br>
                <br>
                More broadly, I learned that you can have fun with the creation process of a product, did I mention that
                before it was
                Phoenix the logo was my face? and that Tailwind Css was the way to go.
