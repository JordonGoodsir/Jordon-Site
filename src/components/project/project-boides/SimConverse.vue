            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">How it started</h3>
            <p>After my time at Always Here's, it was time for something new. That is when an opportunity at SimConverse
                presented itself,
                a few members from my old team and myself were tasked with re-implementing the SimConverse platform.
                We learned the stack and the code base as quickly as we could, flipping the product in only a short time and
                ultimately raising the custom NPS four times its prior.

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">My Approach</h3>
            <p>In this case I had a stable foundation of knowledge, and I intended on using it,
                making the most readable and reusable code as
                possible. Adhering to the <a href="https://dev.to/berryjam/introducing-atomic-design-in-vuejs-1l2h"
                    target="_blank">Atomic</a>
                ideology with each
                component I crafted, ensuring re-usability in the new custom component library. Being a small team I began
                expanding my skill set to design (which was used to make this site in Figma) to help with the workload, this
                being inspired by the
                designing skills of
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bepaterson/" target="_blank">Ben Paterson</a> and <a

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">Learning Experiences</h3>
            <p> I learned that I should always be trying to improve the quality of the code I write, by exploring different
                tools/ideologies and revisiting fundamentals of programming. This is because there are always updated/new
                useful tools released, for example in Vue 3.4 came "Define Model", a useful macro that can save countless
                lines of code improving readability.
