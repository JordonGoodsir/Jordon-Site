            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">How it started</h3>
            <p>After Always Here's demise, it was time for something new. That is when SimConverse came around, myself and
                a few members from my old team were tasked with reinventing the style of SimConverse and that's just what we did.
                learning the stack and the code base as quickly as we could, flipping the product in only a short time.

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">My Approach</h3>
            <p>In this case I had a stable foundation of knowledge, and I intended on using it,
                making the most readable and reusable code as
                possible. Adhering to the <a href="https://dev.to/berryjam/introducing-atomic-design-in-vuejs-1l2h"
                    target="_blank">Atomic</a>
                ideology with each
                component I crafted. With plans to expand my skill set to design (which was used to make this site in
                figma), inspired by
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bepaterson/" target="_blank">Ben Paterson</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bepaterson/" target="_blank">Joel Tankard</a>,
                who were always a pleasure to work with and made amazing
                designs.

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">Learning Experiences</h3>
            <p> I learned that I should always be trying to improve the code I write, by exploring difference tools,
                ideologies and revisiting fundamentals of programming. This being because there are always new useful tools and
                updates being released for example in Vue 3.4 they came out with "Define Model" a useful macro which can
                save countless lines of code and is easily readable.
