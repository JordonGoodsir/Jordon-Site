            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">How it started</h3>
            <p>After completing a bootcamp at CoderAcademy, I was setup with a slew of interviews. However
                by far the best interview was at Always here, a technical test that I flew through and the
                best interviewers bringing forward amazing energy. Not only this, the company was founded on
                the basis to help families mental health post Covid-19, one couldn't ask for a better cause.

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">My Approach</h3>
            <p>Being completely new to the workforce and to coding, aside form my bootcamp, I saw only one
                approach, learn. Myself along with 2 other interns embarked on hours of trial and error,
                thrown thoroughly in the deep end, learning from our mentors as best we could. Although
                imposter syndrome may have kicked in a few times in those early days, I feel as though it
                only made me stronger and better developer.</p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">Learning Experiences</h3>
            <p>I learned a a lot at my time with the Always Here team not only technically, but how to truly
                collaborate as a team.
                <br>
                <br>
                Technically speaking, some of the things I learned include a completely new stack, the
                importance of building reusable components and
                How to develop on IOS/Android and all the annoying nuances
                that came with them (like having your app rejected from the store over one word).
                <br>
                <br>

                More broadly I learned to be even more curious about how things work and to ask questions in
                bulk, doing the things you can do and saving up a few questions for when someones free. Oh
                and I also learned that having a office dog is amazing (miss you axe <img class="rounded h-4 inline-block"
                    src="@/assets/axe.png" />
                ).
