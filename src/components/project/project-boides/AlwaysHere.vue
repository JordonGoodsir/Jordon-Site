            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">How it started</h3>
            <p>After completing a bootcamp at CoderAcademy, I was set up with a slew of interviews. However,
                by far, the best interview was at "Always Here", consisting of a technical test that I flew through with the
                best interviewers bringing forward amazing energy. Not only this, the company was founded on the basis of
                helping families mental with their health post-Covid-19, one couldn't ask for a better cause or a better
                environment to improve.

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">My Approach</h3>
            <p>Being completely new to the workforce and to programming, aside from my education, I saw only one approach...
                <strong>learn</strong>. Two other interns and I embarked on hours of trial and error,
                thrown thoroughly into the deep end, learning from our mentors as best we could. This being said imposter
                syndrome promptly ensued in the early days, and although it was difficult, looking back I feel as though it
                only made me a better developer.

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">Learning Experiences</h3>
            <p>During my time with the team "Always Here" I learned a lot, not only technically in my progression from
                Intern -> Junior -> Frontend Developer but also broader lessons that I will carry throughout my career.
                <br>
                <br>
                In terms of technical ability, my skill set expanded exponentially. Learning not only about the intricacies
                of cross-browser integration but also cross-platform, with Always Here being accessible on iOS/Android in
                their respective app store and across all major browsers. The App’s level of accessibility taught me the
                importance of tested and reusable components.
                <br>
                <br>

                More broadly I learned to be even more curious about how things work and to not feel restricted by your
                role, as especially in the startup industry it is necessary to “wear many hats”. Oh
                and I also learned that having an office dog is amazing (miss you Axe). <img
