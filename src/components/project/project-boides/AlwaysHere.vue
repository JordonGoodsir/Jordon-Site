            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">How it started</h3>
            <p>After completing a bootcamp at CoderAcademy, I was set up with a slew of interviews. However
                by far the best interview was at "Always Here", a technical test that I flew through and the
                best interviewers bringing forward amazing energy. Not only this, the company was founded on
                the basis to help families mental with their health post Covid-19, one couldn't ask for a better cause.

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">My Approach</h3>
            <p>Being completely new to the workforce and to coding, aside form my bootcamp, I saw only one
                approach... <strong>learn</strong>. Myself along with two other interns embarked on hours of trial and
                error,
                thrown thoroughly in the deep end, learning from our mentors as best we could. Although
                imposter syndrome may have set in a few times in the early days, I feel as though it
                only made me a better developer.</p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">Learning Experiences</h3>
            <p>I learned a lot during my time with the "Always Here" team not only technically, but
                collaboratively as a team.
                <br>
                <br>
                In terms of technical ability, my skill set expanded exponentially. Learning not only about the intricacies
                of cross-browser integration but also cross-platform, with Always Here being accessible on iOS/Android in
                their respective app store and across all major browsers. The Appâ€™s level of accessibility taught me the
                importance of tested and reusable components.
                <br>
                <br>

                More broadly I learned to be even more curious about how things work, and to ask questions in
                bulk, completing the tasks that were achievable and making a list of questions to ask when the time was
                right. Oh
                and I also learned that having an office dog is amazing (miss you Axe). <img
